                    NEWTON — In a city of 89,000, Peet’s coffee shop was one of roughly 400 businesses selling food and
                    drink, but among fewer than a handful of coffee shops in Newton Centre. For its devoted following,
                    it was something else: a third place between work and home where people could meet.

                    Loneliness might be epidemic on the street, but inside Peet’s, especially when Faye Goldman was
                    behind the counter, you knew you belonged.

                    Cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were
                    modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or
                    elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and
                    pies.

                    Typical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and
                    leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and
                    flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with
                    numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves,
                    nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated
                    with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.[1]

                    A teahouse (mainly Asia)[1] or tearoom (also tea room) is an establishment which primarily serves
                    tea and other light refreshments. A tea room may be a room set aside in a hotel especially for
                    serving afternoon tea, or may be an establishment which only serves cream teas. Although the
                    function of a tearoom may vary according to the circumstance or country, teahouses often serve as
                    centers of social interaction, like coffeehouses.

                    Some cultures have a variety of distinct tea-centered establishments of different types, depending
                    on the national tea culture. For example, the British or American tearoom serves afternoon tea with
                    a variety of small cakes.
